# MEMORY_CONTROLLER_USING_FPGA
## Project Description

This project involves the design and implementation of a synchronous memory controller using Verilog HDL on an FPGA. The controller manages an 8×8 memory array and supports clock-controlled read and write operations. The design is verified through simulation and is suitable for academic and introductory FPGA-based memory system studies.

## Objectives
● Design a synchronous memory controller using Verilog HDL

● Implement clock-controlled read and write operations

● Verify functionality through simulation using a testbench

● Demonstrate the design on an FPGA platform

## Design Specifications

 Memory Depth: 8

Memory Width: 8 bits

Address Width: 3 bits

Read Type: Synchronous

Write Type: Synchronous

Target Platform: FPGA
